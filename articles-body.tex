\section{Membership}

\item\label{cls:subscribers}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    The subscribers to the memorandum are the first members of the association.
  \item
    There are two classes of membership, which may have distinct rights and powers:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Member Spaces. Any organisation which meets the association's definition
              of a ``hackspace'' may be admitted as a Member Space.
      \item Supporter Members. Any person or organisation which supports the
              association's work may be admitted as a Supporter Member.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item The board, or the association by general resolution, may set additional conditions
        that members must meet in order to join.
  \item The board has the right to refuse membership where it believes it is in the best
        interests of the association to do so.
  \item Membership is not transferable.
  \item The association is managed co-operatively so that the Member Spaces, which are the
        main beneficiaries of the association's services, play the principal role in its
        direction. Supporter Members are subject to limits on their powers, as specified
        in article~\ref{vote-weighting}.
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Termination of Membership}

\item
  Membership is terminated if:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    the member dies or, if it is an organisation, ceases to exist;
  \item
    the member resigns by written notice to the association unless, after
    the resignation, there would be fewer than three members;
  \item
    any sum due from the member to the association is not paid in full
    within two weeks of the member being notified it is due;
  \item
    the member is considered by the board to have violated the Code of Conduct,
    and the Code of Conduct calls for that member to be expelled; or
  \item
    the member is removed from membership by a general resolution of the
    association. A resolution to remove a member from membership may only
    be passed if the member has been given 21 days' notice in writing of
    the general meeting at which the resolution will be proposed, and has
    been allowed to make representation to that meeting.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{General Meetings}
\item
    The Board may convene a General Meeting whenever they think fit.
\item
    General Meetings shall also be convened on such requisition, or in default
    may be convened by such requisitionists, as provided by section 304 of the
    Companies Act 2006.

\subsection{Proceedings at General Meetings}

\item
    No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a
    quorum is present. A quorum is present if there are three or more

    \item
      a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed
      for the meeting; or

    \end{enumerate}
      the meeting shall be adjourned to such time and place as the directors shall
      determine.
  \item
    The directors must reconvene the meeting and must give at least
    seven clear days' notice of the reconvened meeting stating the
    date, time and place of the meeting.
  \item
    If no quorum is present at the reconvened meeting within fifteen
    minutes of the time specified for the start of the meeting the
    members present in person or by proxy at that time shall constitute
    the quorum for that meeting.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    General meetings shall be chaired by the person who has been
    appointed to chair meetings of the directors.
  \item
    If there is no such person or he or she is not present within
    fifteen minutes of the time appointed for the meeting a director
    nominated by the directors shall chair the meeting.
  \item
    If there is only one director present and willing to act, he or she
    shall chair the meeting.
  \item
    If no director is present and willing to chair the meeting within
    fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding it, the
    members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote must
    choose one of their number to chair the meeting.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    The members present in person or by proxy at a meeting may resolve
    by ordinary resolution that the meeting shall be adjourned.

    The person who is chairing the meeting must decide the date, time
    and place at which the meeting is to be reconvened unless those
    details are specified in the resolution.
  \item
    No business shall be conducted at a reconvened meeting unless it
    could properly have been conducted at the meeting had the
    adjournment not taken place.
  \item
    If a meeting is adjourned by a resolution of the members for more
    than seven days, at least seven clear days' notice shall be given
    of the reconvened meeting stating the date, time and place of the
    meeting.
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Voting at General Meetings}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Any vote at a meeting shall be decided by a show of hands unless
    before, or on the declaration of the result of, the show of hands a
    poll is demanded:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      by the person chairing the meeting; or
    \item
      by at least two members present in person or by proxy and having
      the right to vote at the meeting
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      The declaration by the person who is chairing the meeting of the
      result of a vote shall be conclusive unless a poll is demanded.
    \item
      The result of the vote must be recorded in the minutes of the
      association but the number or proportion of votes cast need not be
      recorded.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      A demand for a poll may be withdrawn, before the poll is taken, but
      only with the consent of the person who is chairing the meeting.
    \item
      If the demand for a poll is withdrawn the demand shall not
      invalidate the result of a show of hands declared before the demand
      was made.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      A poll must be taken as the person who is chairing the meeting
      directs, who may appoint scrutineers (who need not be members) and
      who may fix a time and place for declaring the results of the poll.
    \item
      The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the
      meeting at which the poll is demanded.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      A poll demanded on the election of a person to chair a meeting or
      on a question of adjournment must be taken immediately.
    \item
      A poll demanded on any other question must be taken either
      immediately or at such time and place as the person who is chairing
      the meeting directs.
    \item
      The poll must be taken within thirty days after it has been
      demanded.
    \item
      If the poll is not taken immediately at least seven clear days'
      notice shall be given specifying the time and place at which the
      poll is to be taken.
    \item
      If a poll is demanded, the meeting may continue to deal with any
      other business that may be conducted at the meeting.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{vote-weighting}
    In a counted vote at a general meeting, and in directors elections,
    the votes cast by each class will be weighted (that is, treated as
    being a greater or lesser amount) to ensure that the final
    proportions of votes cast by each class of membership are fixed as
    follows:

    \begin{tabular}{l l r}
      \toprule
      \textbf{Class} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Proportion} \\
      \midrule
      1 & Member Spaces & 80\% \\
      2 & Supporter Members & 20\% \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}

    Votes for each class shall be counted separately. Before combining them,
    the votes cast for or against (and abstentions) shall be established as
    proportions of the available votes in that class. Then the percentage
    share of voting strength allotted to that class, as indicated above,
    shall be applied to each. The votes for and against, along with
    abstentions, shall be established by aggregating the figures for each in
    each class.

    The following qualifications apply to this rule:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        If the effect of this rule would be to give a person more than
        20\% of the total voting strength in a meeting attended by four
        or more Member Spaces, then for the duration of that meeting only
        the voting share for the class to which they belong will be reduced,
        and the voting share of other user member classes increased pro rata.
      \item
        If a class has no members in attendance, the shares of the voting
	strength for other classes are unaffected, subject to 
	article~\ref{voting-noclass}.
      \item
	\label{voting-noclass}
	If a class has no members, it will be treated as if it does not exist,
	and the voting share of the other classes will be increased pro rata.
    \end{enumerate}
\item
      No amendment may be made to these rules that would allow any class of
      member other than Member Spaces to have more than 20\% of the total
      voting strength when there are any members of the Member Spaces class.

      This clause is entrenched in accordance with section 22 of the
      Companies Act 2006; any alteration to this article requires the approval of
      100\% of the Members.
\item
      Any objection to the qualification of any voter must be raised at
      the meeting at which the vote is tendered and the decision of the
      person who is chairing the meeting shall be final.
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
      Any organisation that is a member of the association may nominate any
      person to act as its representative at any meeting of the association.
  \item
      The organisation must give written notice to the association of the
      name of its representative. The representative shall not be
      entitled to represent the organisation at any meeting unless the
      notice has been received by the association. The representative may
      continue to represent the organisation until written notice to the
      contrary is received by the association.
  \item
      Any notice given to the association will be conclusive evidence that
      the representative is entitled to represent the organisation or
      that his or her authority has been revoked. The association shall not
      be required to consider whether the representative has been
      properly appointed by the organisation.
  \end{enumerate}


\section{Content of Proxy Notices}

\item\label{proxies}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Proxies may only validly be appointed by a notice in writing (a
    ``proxy notice'') which ---
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      states the name and address of the member appointing the proxy;
    \item
      identifies the person appointed to be that member's proxy and the
      general meeting in relation to which that person is appointed;
    \item
      is signed by or on behalf of the member appointing the proxy, or is
      authenticated in such manner as the directors may determine; and
    \item
      is delivered to the association in accordance with the articles and any
      instructions contained in the notice of the general meeting to
      which they relate.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    The association may require proxy notices to be delivered in a
    particular form, and may specify different forms for different
    purposes.
  \item
    Proxy notices may specify how the proxy appointed under them is to
    vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more
    resolutions.
  \item
    Unless a proxy notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated as ---
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to
      how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the
      meeting; and
    \item
      appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment of
      the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting
      itself.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Delivery of Proxy Notices}

\item
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        A person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote
        (either on a show of hands or on a poll) at a general meeting
        remains so entitled in respect of that meeting or any adjournment
        of it, even though a valid proxy notice has been delivered to the
        association by or on behalf of that person.
        \item
        An appointment under a
        proxy notice may be revoked by delivering to the association a notice
        in writing given by or on behalf of the person by whom or on whose
        behalf the proxy notice was given.
        \item
        A notice revoking a proxy
        appointment only takes effect if it is delivered before the start
        of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which it relates
        \item
        If a
        proxy notice is not executed by the person appointing the proxy, it
        must be accompanied by written evidence of the authority of the
        person who executed it to execute it on the appointor's behalf.
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Written Resolutions}

\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item

\section{Proceedings of Directors}
\item The Board of Directors may meet together for the despatch of business,
  adjourn and otherwise regulate their meetings as they think fit.

\item A Director is able to exercise the right to speak at a meeting of the
  Board of Directors and is deemed to be in attendance when that person is in a
  position to communicate to all those attending the meeting. The Directors may
  make whatever arrangements they consider appropriate to enable those
  attending a meeting of the Board of Directors to exercise their rights to
  speak or vote at it including by Electronic Means. In determining attendance
  at a meeting of the Board of Directors, it is immaterial whether any two or
  more Directors attending are in the same place as each other.

  votes. In the case of an equality of votes the status quo shall be maintained
  and the Board of Directors may choose to refer the matter to a general
  meeting of the Association.

\item A written resolution, circulated to all Directors and signed by a simple
  majority of Directors, shall be valid and effective as if it had been passed
  at a Board meeting duly convened and held. A written resolution may consist
  of several identical Documents signed by one or more Directors.

\item The Board of Directors may, at its discretion, invite other persons to
  attend its meetings with or without speaking rights and without voting
  rights. Such attendees will not count toward the quorum.

\item
    Where on any particular occasion more than 2 directors, in the course of their
    office as directors, discuss the affairs of the Company by any means, whether in person
    or otherwise, a minute shall be made and recorded indicating:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item
                when the discussion took place;
            \item
                the identities of the directors involved; and
            \item
                the substance of the discussion.
        \end{enumerate}
\item
    Minutes of directors meetings:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item
                may be held in electronic form;
            \item
                must be held for ten years from the date of the discussion in accordance with section

  A director must declare the nature and extent of any interest,
  direct or indirect, which he or she has in a proposed transaction
  or arrangement with the association or in any transaction or
  arrangement entered into by the association which has not previously
  been declared. A director must absent himself or herself from any
  discussions of the directors in which it is possible that a
  conflict will arise between his or her duty to act solely in the
      interests of the association and any personal interest (including but
  not limited to any personal financial interest).

\section{Conflicts of Interests}

\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    If a conflict of interests arises for a director because of a duty
    of loyalty owed to another organisation or person and the conflict
    is not authorised by virtue of any other provision in the articles,
    the unconflicted directors may authorise such a conflict of
    interests where the following conditions apply:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      the conflicted director is absent from the part of the meeting at
      which there is discussion of any arrangement or transaction
      affecting that other organisation or person;
    \item
      the conflicted director does not vote on any such matter and is not
      to be counted when considering whether a quorum of directors is
      present at the meeting; and
    \item
      the unconflicted directors consider it is in the interests of the
      association to authorise the conflict of interests in the circumstances
      applying.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item\label{conflict-interest-loyalty}
    In this article a conflict of interests arising because of a duty
    of loyalty owed to another organisation or person only refers to
    such a conflict which does not involve a direct or indirect benefit
    of any nature to a director.

    \item
      who was disqualified from holding office;
    \item
      who had previously retired or who had been obliged by the
      constitution to vacate office;

      who was not entitled to vote on the matter, whether by reason of a
      conflict of interests or otherwise; if without:
    \item
      the vote of that director; and
    \item
      that director being counted in the quorum; the decision has been
      made by a majority of the directors at a quorate meeting.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item\label{directors-validity-void}
    Article~\ref{directors-validity} does not permit a director to
    keep any benefit that may be conferred upon him or her by a
    resolution of the directors or of a committee of directors if, but
